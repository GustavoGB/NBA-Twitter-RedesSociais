      "Lo de Carmelo Anthony en los Rockets de momento no est\u00e1 funcionando demasiado bien. Ni \u00e9l est\u00e1 haciendo buenos n\u00fameros en separado, ni su aportaci\u00f3n al equipo es positiva. Ayer fue el d\u00eda que menos puntos anot\u00f3 un equipo entrenado por Mike D'Antoni. # NBAhttps://twitter.com/jphanned/status/1060769084365668355 \u2026",

      "Carmelo Anthony was 1-11 last night and his only \u201cmade\u201d shot was a goaltend and the Rockets continue to suck since he joined them..Melo should be traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves and let him live at the Mayo Clinic as a case study # Cancer",
